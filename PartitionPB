# Partition Problem

In number theory and computer science, the partition problem, or number partitioning,
is the task of deciding whether a given multiset S of positive integers can be partitioned
into two subsets S1 and S2 such that the sum of the numbers in S1 equals the sum of the numbers in S2.
Although the partition problem is NP-complete(Problems that do not have solutions in quadratic time),
there is a pseudo-polynomial time dynamic programming solution, and there are heuristics that solve
the problem in many instances, either optimally or approximately. For this reason, it has been called
"the easiest hard problem".

There is an optimization version of the partition problem, which is to partition the multiset S
into two subsets S1, S2 such that the difference between the sum of elements in S1 and
the sum of elements in S2 is minimized.
The optimization version is NP-hard, but can be solved efficiently in practice.
